# ziral — design plan

A hypothesis, not a spec. Short, living, rewritten after the first playable.

## Pitch

One sentence: who the player is, what they do, why that is fun.

Zoomed in, its a automation puzzle game, as the game progresses, as the player zooms out, it turns into an engineering game.

## Core loop

Zoomed loop: similar to Opus Magnum.
Wide loop: similar to Factorio.

The boundary between zoomed in and zoomed out is fuzzy. Zoomed in, the puzzles are Opus Magnum-like; zooming out raises the level of abstraction. Mistakes at the micro level cause macro problems, and vice versa. The hard problems, as in Factorio, are planning, robustness, and managing complexity.

## Progression

Factorio's model. Progression unlocks mechanics and reveals the next challenge, each to be received with dismay. Science compounds are combined, then consumed to advance research. Each research tier demands new molecules, which demands new machines: that is what pulls the player back into the micro loop.

## Feel

Minute editing comes from Opus Magnum. Zoomed out editing comes from factorio, copy-paste included.

## First playable

One micro editor: a small hex grid, two arms, bond and unbond, an instruction tape. One wide view: instances of that machine on a grid, joined by belts. One goal: deliver N of one molecule per minute. Graybox, circles and lines.

Falsifier: the machine gets designed once and never revisited. Then zoom-in is a tutorial, not a loop, and the pitch fails.

The bridge that should prevent that: Opus Magnum's three scores are Factorio's three pressures. Cost is resources, cycles is throughput, area is footprint. The wide game must demand a faster, smaller, or cheaper machine often enough that the player zooms back in.

## Out of scope

Art. Research tree. Enemies. Power. Fluids. Multiplayer. More than one molecule family. Save compatibility.

## Parking lot

Ideas that are not in the plan.

## Open questions

How do we limit simulation load? Limit number of atoms?
Proposal: a finished machine is deterministic and periodic, so it compiles to a throughput function (period, inputs per period, outputs per period). The wide simulation runs the compiled form; the atom simulation runs only for machines in view or being edited. Cap atoms per machine, not per world. Unresolved: what a machine does when an input belt is empty or an output belt is full (stall the whole tape, or per-arm waits) decides whether the compiled form stays exact.

How do we let player actively design and recover from mistakes. Debug step forward and back? Localized debug step?
Proposal: determinism gives step forward for free and step back by replay from a checkpoint. Localized step is the same on one machine with its recorded input stream.

Are placed instances linked to one definition (edit once, all update) or independent copies? Linked gives blueprints plus an upgrade path.
